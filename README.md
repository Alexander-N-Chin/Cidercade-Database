## Prompt
Objective: Use object-oriented programming to implement and utilize a binary search tree
Problem: Barcades have become very popular venues over the last few years. A local barcade, Bishop Cidercade, is
working to open near downtown Dallas. Before they open, they need help establishing a system to track information
on all of their games. They have hired you to build this system with a simple interface allowing them to manipulate
and search the data. (more detailed information in project description pdf)
