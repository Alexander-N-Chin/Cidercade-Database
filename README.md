# Cidercade Database

The Cidercade Database takes an input file, creates a binary search tree with the record data, and executes five commands (insert, search, edit, remove, traverse) based on an inputted batch commands file. (academic project from Jason Smith's Computer Science II Class)

C++


## Lessons Learned

I learned how to insert, search, remove, and traverse a binary search tree implemented using node objects and pointers. I also learned how to effectively document my code to improve readability, and improve workflow. 


## Prompt

Barcades have become very popular venues over the last few years. A local barcade, Bishop Cidercade, is
working to open near downtown Dallas. Before they open, they need help establishing a system to track information
on all of their games. They have hired you to build this system with a simple interface allowing them to manipulate
and search the data. (more detailed information in project description pdf)
